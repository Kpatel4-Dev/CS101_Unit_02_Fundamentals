### Step 2 Create your function definition for calc_car_emissions here
'''Calculates the average annual vehicle emissions using equation from cell C9
Parameters
----------
mpg
vehicle's average miles per gallon
avg_miles_driven
average number of miles driven per year
'''
FUNCTION calc_car_emissions PASS IN two parameter
    CALACULATE result = 1/mpg + avg_miles_driven + 19.6 * 100/98.65
    RETURN result

# MAIN PROGRAM:
# beginning of running program
##########################################

# Get input from user
# Since we are going to be calling the function calc_car_emissions(mpg, avg_miles_driven)
# We know that we are going to need a variable for mpg and avg_miles_driven

GET avg_mpg INTEGER input from the user ASSIGN the value to mpg
GET avg_miles_driven INTEGER input from the user ASSIGN the value to avg_miles_driven

# We now have the two variables we need for our calc_car_emissions, so we can call it with those values
# We are also going to assign the value to a variable so we can use it later

CALL calc_car_emissions FUNCTION PASS IN the mpg from the user and miles driven from the user
ASSIGN the returned value from the function to car_emissions variable

# Print out the values

CALCULATE us_avg = calc_car_emissions(21.6, 219 * 52)

DISPLAY "The average US car produces _____ pounds of CO2 per year" FORMATTED to 2 decimal places

# Calculate and print the two comparison values

ADD 2 to user mpg input and ASSIGN that value to mpg1 varible

CALL FUNCTION mpg1 and user entered avg_miles_driven values and ASSIGN the returned value from the function to variable car_emissions1
GET the DIFFERENCE of car_emissions and car_emissions1 SAVE the result in a variable called difference

DISPLAY blank line for formatting

DISPLAY " If your mpg was _____, then your car emissions would be _____ pounds of CO2 per year. That's about ____pounds less!" FORMATTED to 2 decimal places 

CALCULATE avg_miles_driven1 = avg_miles_driven * 0.9

CALL FUNCTION and PASS IN user mpg and avg_miles_driven1 and ASSIGN the returned value to a variable car_emissions2
GET the DIFFERENCE of car_emissions and car_emissions2 SAVE the result in a variable called difference

DISPLAY blank line for formatting 

DISPLAY "If you drove 10%% less miles, then your annual car emissions would be
____ pounds of CO2 per year. That's about _____ pounds less!" FORMATTED to 2
decimal places
